INTRODUCTION
IN THIS ASSIGNMENT YOU ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT FROM SCRATCH, USING C, A SIMPLE CRYPTOGRAPHIC
LIBRARY NAMED CS457_CRYPTO. THE CRYPTOGRAPHIC LIBRARY WILL PROVIDE FOUR BASIC BUT FUNDAMENTAL
CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS, (I) ONE-TIME PAD, (II) CAESARâ€™S CIPHER, (III) PLAYFAIR CIPHER, (IV) AFFINE
CIPHER AND (V) FEISTEL CIPHER. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS ASSIGNMENT IS TO OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GET FAMILIAR WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION AND INTERNALS OF SUCH SIMPLE CIPHERS AND HELP YOU
UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS AND TRICKS THAT DEVELOPERS HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHEN
IMPLEMENTING SECURITY CRITICAL FUNCTIONS THAT, AT FIRST, SEEM TRIVIAL TO DEVELOP.
THE CS457_CRYPTO LIBRARY WILL CONSIST OF TWO FILES. THE CS457_CRYPTO.H, WHICH CONTAINS THE C
FUNCTION DECLARATIONS AND ANY MACRO DEFINITIONS YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT AND THE CS457_CRYPTO.C
FILE, CONTAINING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ABOVE ALGORITHMS.
