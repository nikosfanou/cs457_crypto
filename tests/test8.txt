ONE-TIME PAD
THE ONE-TIME-PAD (OTP) ALGORITHM IS A VERY SIMPLE BUT YET VERY STRONG ALGORITHM IN THE SENSE
THAT IT CAN NOT BE CRACKED EVEN WITH QUANTUM COMPUTERS. THE ALGORITHM PAIRS EACH PLAINTEXT WITH
A RANDOM SECRET KEY (ALSO REFERRED TO AS A ONE-TIME PAD). SPECIFICALLY, EACH BIT OR BYTE/CHARACTER
OF THE PLAINTEXT IS COMBINED WITH THE CORRESPONDING BIT OR BYTE/CHARACTER FROM THE RANDOM SECRET
KEY. ONE-TIME PAD REQUIRES THAT THE SECRET KEY IS OF THE SAME SIZE OR LONGER THAN THE PLAINTEXT.
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
IN ORDER TO GENERATE A RANDOM SECRET KEY YOU WILL USE A PSEUDORANDOM GENERATOR, SUCH AS
/DEV/URANDOM. THE PSEUDORANDOM GENERATOR WILL READ N RANDOM CHARACTERS FROM /DEV/URANDOM,
WHERE N IS THE NUMBER OF BYTES/CHARACTERS FOUND IN THE PLAINTEXT. THEN, THE ALGORITHM WILL
ENCRYPT EACH BYTE/CHARACTER OF THE PLAINTEXT BY XOR-ING IT WITH THE CORRESPONDING BYTE/CHARACTER
OF THE RANDOM SECRET KEY.
SINCE /DEV/URANDOM WILL RETURN A NEW RANDOM VALUE UPON EACH READ, YOU WILL FIRST NEED TO
GENERATE AN APPROPRIATE SIZED RANDOM SECRET KEY AND STORE IT IN MEMORY IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY
DECRYPT THE ENCRYPTED MESSAGE. FOR THIS FUNCTIONALITY YOU CAN DEVELOP YOUR OWN SEPARATE
FUNCTION OR MACRO. ALSO, SINCE THE USAGE OF /DEV/URANDOM IS OUR SUGGESTED PSEUDORANDOM
GENERATOR, YOU ARE ADVISED TO USE A LINUX-BASED SYSTEM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF THE
OTP ALGORITHM. THE FUNCTION(S) ENCRYPTING AND DECRYPTING THE MESSAGES SHOULD RECEIVE AS
ARGUMENTS THE PLAIN- OR CIPHER-TEXT AS WELL AS THE RANDOM SECRET KEY AND SHOULD RETURN THE RESULT
OF THE OPERATION. SPECIAL CHARACTERS, SUCH AS “!”, “@”, “*”, ETC. THAT ARE NOT PART OF THE ENGLISH
ALPHABET SHOULD BE SKIPPED AS IF THE CHARACTER SET ONLY CONSISTS OF NUMBERS 0-9 FOLLOWED BY
UPPERCASE CHARACTERS A-Z AND LOWERCASE CHARACTERS A-Z. THE SAME APPLIES FOR ALL THE REST OF THE
PRINTABLE AND NON-PRINTABLE ASCII CHARACTERS SUCH AS “\N”, “\T”, “\0” ETC. NOTICE THAT XOR-ING
SPECIFIC CHARACTERS TOGETHER MIGHT RESULT IN NON-PRINTABLE CHARACTERS OR EVEN “\0”. FOR THIS REASON
YOU SHOULD THINK AROUND THIS PROBLEM WHEN HANDLING AND PRINTING ANY RESULTS.
