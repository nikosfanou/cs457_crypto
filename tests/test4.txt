Playfair cipher
The Playfair cipher encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), instead of single letters as is the case
with simpler substitution ciphers such as the Caesar Cipher. The key element of this cipher is a
5x5 grid that represents the key. In order to create the table, the letters of the key are placed in
the grid, from left to right beginning from the first row. Then the rest of the alphabet’s letters are
inserted in the grid alphabetically. Each letter is placed once in the grid. Since the 5x5 grid can
only hold 25 characters J is usually omitted and treated as ‘I’. For example the key grid for the
pass phrase “HELLO WORLD” will create the following key grid 1 :
During the encryption the plaintext is broken in groups of two letters. If the letters of the group
are the same the second letter is replaced with ‘X’. If the number of the letters in the plaintext is
even, the last letters are grouped with an ‘X’ character. For example, “WILL ATTACK AT
DAWN” will result in:
“WI L X AT TA CK AT DA WN”
For each group of letters:
If the letters appear on the same row of the key grid, they will be replaced with the letters to their
immediate right respectively (wrapping around to the left side of the row if a letter in the original
pair was on the right side of the row). For example, “DA” will be encrypted to “ AB ”.
If the letters appear on the same column of the key grid, they will be replaced with the letters
immediately below respectively (wrapping around to the top side of the column if a letter in the
original pair was on the bottom side of the column). For example, “ LX ” will be encrypted to “ AL ”.
If the letters are not on the same row or column, they will be replaced with the letters on the
same row respectively but at the other pair of corners of the rectangle defined by the original
1 Note that each letter in the key is used only once

pair. The order is important – the first letter of the encrypted pair is the one that lies on the same
row as the first letter of the plaintext pair. For example “ WI” will be encrypted to “ LM” , “ AT” to
“ CQ ”, “ CK ” to “ BM ”, etc.
The ciphertext of the above scenario will be, “LM AL CQ QC BM CQ AB HT”.
In order to decrypt the message the inverse of the encryption rules is used.
Implementation details
The characters that can be found in the alphabet should only be the uppercase characters A-Z,
thus lowercase characters a-z, digits 0-9 or any other ASCII characters should not be used. You
should omit character ‘J’ from the key grid and replace any occurence in the plaintext with
character ‘I’. If the number of letters in the plaintext is even, the last letter of the plaintext must
be grouped with an ‘X’ character. The function(s) encrypting and decrypting the messages
should receive as arguments the plain- or cipher-text as well as the keyphrase and should
return the result of the operation.
