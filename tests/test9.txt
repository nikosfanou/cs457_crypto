CAESAR'S CIPHER
THIS TECHNIQUE IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND MOST WIDELY KNOWN ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUES. IT IS A TYPE
OF SUBSTITUTION CIPHER IN WHICH EACH BYTE/CHARACTER OF THE PLAINTEXT IS REPLACED BY A
BYTE/CHARACTER FOUND AT SOME FIXED NUMBER OF POSITIONS DOWN THE ALPHABET/ASCII SET. FOR
EXAMPLE, GIVEN THE ASCII CHARACTER SET, A SHIFT OF 3 WILL REPLACE THE LETTER “A” OF THE PLAINTEXT
WITH THE LETTER “D” AT THE CIPHERTEXT. ALSO, A SHIFT OF 4 WILL ENCRYPT THE PLAINTEXT “HELLO” AS “LIPPS”.
THE FUNCTION(S) ENCRYPTING AND DECRYPTING THE MESSAGES SHOULD RECEIVE AS ARGUMENTS THE PLAINOR
CIPHER-TEXT AS WELL AS THE RANDOM SECRET KEY AND SHOULD RETURN THE RESULT OF THE OPERATION.
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
THE IMPLEMENTATION SHOULD SUPPORT NUMBERS, UPPERCASE AND LOWERCASE CHARACTERS. SPECIAL
CHARACTERS, SUCH AS “!”, “@”, “*”, ETC. THAT ARE NOT PART OF THE ENGLISH ALPHABET SHOULD BE SKIPPED
AS IF THE CHARACTER SET ONLY CONSISTS OF NUMBERS 0-9 FOLLOWED BY UPPERCASE CHARACTERS A-Z AND
LOWERCASE CHARACTERS A-Z. THE SAME APPLIES FOR ALL THE REST OF THE PRINTABLE AND NON-PRINTABLE
ASCII CHARACTERS SUCH AS “\N”, “\T”, “\0” ETC. THE FUNCTION(S) ENCRYPTING AND DECRYPTING THE
MESSAGES SHOULD RECEIVE AS ARGUMENTS THE PLAIN- OR CIPHER-TEXT AS WELL AS A POSITIVE NUMBER
INDICATING THE NUMBER OF SHIFTED POSITIONS AND SHOULD RETURN THE RESULT OF THE OPERATION.
